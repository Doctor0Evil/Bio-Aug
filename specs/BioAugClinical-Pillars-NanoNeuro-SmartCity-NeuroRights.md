# BioAugClinical Pillars Integration (Nanotech BMIs, Stimuli-Responsive Neuromodulation, Neuromorphic, Neuro-Smart-Cities, Neuro-Rights)

- Pillar 1: Stimuli-responsive neuromodulatory nanomaterials for wireless, precise neuromodulation with safety envelopes and stability requirements. [web:10][web:15]
- Pillar 2: Nanotech BMIs and flexible interfaces for dense, chronic neural recording/stimulation plus ethics and jurisprudence integration. [web:2]
- Pillar 3: Neuromorphic compute as brain-like backend for hybrid AI–human control (closed-loop BCIs, cyber-physical systems). [web:12]
- Pillar 4: Neuro-aware smart-city infrastructure and hybrid intelligence governance (human-centric, SDG-aligned, privacy-preserving). [web:8]

All safety-affecting policies and guards binding to these pillars MUST:
- Declare IEC 62304 Class C.
- Link to ISO 14971 clauses and neuro-rights/governance controls.
- Enforce explicit safety envelopes and hybrid AI–human oversight where decisions affect therapy or city-scale actuation.
