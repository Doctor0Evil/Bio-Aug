# Bio-Aug Neuromorphic Dataset Template V1

- Goal: structured, temporally-precise event datasets compatible with neuromorphic benchmarks (e.g., temporally-structured spiking datasets, synthetic augmentation). [web:20][web:21]
- Contents:
  - ALN schema references (NanoNeuro.Datasets.v2, Neuromorphic.v1).
  - Expected spike/LFP formats, timing resolution, and behavioral labels.
  - Guidelines for noise models and augmentation compatible with neuromorphic training. [web:22]
