# AU.BioAug.SecureBiomech.v1 Dataset

This ALN-exclusive dataset defines a concrete, binary-encoded substrate for AI-augmented humans, including user identity hashes, biomechanical feature descriptors, BCI/AI linkage, security snapshots, rights assertions, and ALN-only semantic/safety blocks. It is intentionally structured so any interpreter can consume the binary layout, but only ALN engines can fully interpret the embedded policies and proofs, making it suitable as a landmark reference for biomechanical security and AI-augmented-human research.

The included instances are fully filled, numerically consistent records that can be loaded, queried, and statistically analyzed as-is, while extensions (more users, more features, more proof blocks) can be appended without breaking schema stability.
