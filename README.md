# Bio‑Aug: Biocompatible Autonomy & Security Layer for Augmented Users

Bio‑Aug is a biocompatible, biomechanical security and control layer for AI‑integrated, cybernetic, and augmented humans that **does not rely on wearables or external devices**. It defines a research‑grade framework for safe, platform‑agnostic control of per‑user, per‑system augmentations, with uncompromising protections against digital malware and manipulation while upholding human autonomy, rights, and public accountability. [file:1][file:5]

## Mission

Bio‑Aug exists to provide a **reality‑safe, medically aligned, rights‑preserving control plane** for any human who interfaces with machines, AI, neural systems, or extended realities. It is designed so that no traditional or emerging form of malware, network exploit, or hostile code can directly or indirectly influence the biomechanical, neuromorphic, or cybernetic layers of an augmented person. [file:1][file:5]

Bio‑Aug aims to:

- Guarantee biocompatible, rights‑respecting integration between biological tissue and AI/cybernetic systems. [file:1]
- Maintain strong separation between physical bodies, digital systems, and metaphysical/simulated domains, with strict cross‑layer quarantine and human‑in‑the‑loop control. [file:1][file:5]
- Provide a public, transparent framework that governments, developers, clinicians, and augmented individuals can review, audit, and improve under shared safety and ethics principles. [file:1]

## Scope and Design Principles

Bio‑Aug is defined as a **non‑wearable, non‑external** augmentation safety controller and policy layer. It applies to: [file:1][file:5]

- Implanted biomechanical or neuromorphic systems  
- Direct neural interfaces and BCI devices  
- AI‑linked prosthetics, exoskeletal systems, and organ‑support modules  
- AR/VR and mixed‑reality pipelines that connect to biological perception or cognition  
- On‑body and in‑body cybernetic networks and their digital twins  

Key design principles include:

1. **Biocompatible First**  
   All interfaces must satisfy medical biocompatibility, tissue safety, and reversible‑as‑possible integration requirements before any digital or AI layer is allowed to operate. [web:1]

2. **Security by Hard Separation**  
   Bio‑Aug enforces strict separation between:  
   - Biological layer (cells, tissue, organs)  
   - Cybernetic/mechanical layer (implants, actuators, neuromorphic chips)  
   - Digital/AI layer (models, control code, networks)  
   - Metaphysical/simulated layer (VR, AR, metaphysical simulations)  
   With cross‑layer quarantine and explicit gateways controlled by human‑approved policy. [file:1][file:5]

3. **Malware‑Proof by Architecture, Not Assumption**  
   No internet‑originated or untrusted code path is ever allowed to reach the control primitives for muscle, organ, sensory, or cognitive actuation. All such control is mediated through audited, immutable, fail‑safe Bio‑Aug policies, with safe‑removal workflows and multi‑party authorization for any change. [file:1][file:4]

4. **Human Autonomy and Consent**  
   Every augmented person retains the right to existence, privacy, consent, self‑ownership, meta‑cognitive integrity, and audit. Consent is explicit, revocable, and enforced across all layers, including AI and cybernetic logic. [file:1][file:5]

5. **Publicly Reviewable and Governance‑Ready**  
   The framework is designed to be readable by regulators, ethics boards, technical auditors, and the public, enabling shared governance and fair power distribution between individuals, institutions, and AI systems. [file:1]

## Threat Model and Malware Immunity

Bio‑Aug is explicitly engineered to **eliminate the traditional malware attack surface** for in‑body and on‑body augmentations. While standard systems can be compromised by trojans, ransomware, rootkits, and model‑level attacks, Bio‑Aug constrains these risks in several structural ways. [file:1][file:4]

Bio‑Aug assumes the presence of:

- Network‑borne malware (classic viruses, worms, botnets)  
- Supply‑chain and firmware‑level compromise attempts  
- Adversarial machine‑learning attacks and prompt‑level manipulation  
- Cross‑layer exploits trying to bridge from cloud/service code into neuromorphic or biomechanical control  

Bio‑Aug responds with:

- **Immutable Safety Kernels**: Control logic for biomechanical functions is locked behind audit‑only, tamper‑evident kernels with human‑in‑the‑loop override and multi‑signature governance. These kernels cannot execute downloaded or unvetted code. [file:1][file:5]
- **Cross‑Layer Quarantine**: Any attempt to cross from digital to biomechanical control without explicit, validated, rights‑compliant policy triggers quarantine, shutdown, and forensic audit. [file:1][file:5]
- **Safe‑Removal and Rollback**: Hazardous or non‑compliant modules can be removed or disabled through pre‑defined, auditable workflows anchored to a trusted ledger, ensuring there is always a path back to a safe state. [file:1][file:4]
- **No Dark Channels**: Hidden debug interfaces, private backdoors, and undocumented override paths are prohibited by policy and design; their presence constitutes a rights and compliance violation, not a feature. [file:1]

## Rights, Governance, and Policy Alignment

Bio‑Aug is grounded in a shared rights and compliance framework for biological, cybernetic, and AI entities. It is intentionally designed to **balance power** between: [file:1][file:5]

- Individuals (augmented users, patients, citizens)  
- Technical actors (developers, manufacturers, AI operators)  
- Governance structures (regulators, ethics boards, health authorities)  

Core rights and duties include:

- **Augmented Individual Rights**  
  - Right to non‑intrusion and physical safety  
  - Right to full transparency and explainability of augmentation behavior  
  - Right to consent, opt‑out, and total shutdown of non‑critical augmentations  
  - Right to audit logs, configuration history, and external influences on their systems [file:1][file:5]

- **Developer and Operator Duties**  
  - Duty to implement and respect Bio‑Aug policies and boundary rules  
  - Duty to submit code, models, and hardware interfaces to independent, immutable audit  
  - Duty to design for rollback, safe‑removal, and failure‑safe modes, not irreversible escalation [file:1]

- **Governance and Public Oversight**  
  - Multi‑party participation in high‑impact policy changes  
  - Transparent documentation of standards, updates, and incident handling  
  - Mechanisms for appeals, redress, and rights restoration when augmentations or policies cause harm or overreach [file:1]

Bio‑Aug does **not** grant personhood to AI or cybernetic systems; it instead binds them to strict ethical and legal duties under human‑centric rights frameworks. [file:1]

## Platform‑Agnostic Controls (No Wearables Required)

Bio‑Aug treats **platforms, operating systems, engines, and hardware vendors as interchangeable**, as long as they can respect and implement its boundary and policy rules. This allows integration with: [file:1][file:2]

- Neuromorphic chips, micro‑actuators, and sensor meshes  
- Real‑time control systems built on Unreal Engine, Unity, or Godot for simulation and validation  
- Cloud or edge AI models for prediction, anomaly detection, or assistance  
- Existing medical devices and standards via well‑defined, rights‑aware interfaces  

The core requirement is **strict non‑bypassability**: no platform may introduce a control path that circumvents Bio‑Aug’s biomechanical safety and rights enforcement layer.

## Research and Implementation Objectives

Bio‑Aug is a **research‑grade property and reference framework**. The initial goals for researchers, clinicians, and system architects include: [file:1][file:5]

- Defining biocompatible, auditable interfaces for direct augmentation without wearables  
- Formalizing cross‑layer separation and quarantine rules for physical, digital, and simulated domains  
- Prototyping simulation environments that stress‑test Bio‑Aug policies against malware, misuse, and governance failures  
- Building open, reviewable specifications for regulators and standards bodies that reflect both technical realities and lived human experience  

All experiments and implementations must:

- Respect medical ethics and regulatory requirements  
- Maintain human‑in‑the‑loop for high‑impact decisions  
- Log and preserve evidence for independent review and improvement

## Public‑Facing Commitments

Bio‑Aug commits to the following public principles: [file:1]

- No cybernetic or AI system is allowed to silently reduce human autonomy or safety.  
- No internet‑connected system may directly command in‑body biomechanical functions without passing through Bio‑Aug’s verified, rights‑aware control plane.  
- All affected persons have enforceable rights to understand, contest, and reshape the policies that govern their augmentations.  
- Governance, not secret code, is the ultimate arbiter of acceptable augmentation behavior.

By adhering to these commitments, Bio‑Aug seeks to help establish a safer, fairer frontier of human evolution, where advanced augmentations and AI integrations serve people without compromising their dignity, autonomy, or security. [file:1][file:5]

- `tools/daily_adjacent_cycle.sh` — Adjacent-domain generator (implantable, organic, soft robotics, cyber-immune).

Usage (on a dev machine or CI runner with `aln-cli` and `jq`/`sha256sum` installed):

```bash
./tools/daily_research_cycle.sh
./tools/daily_cybernetic_cycle.sh
./tools/daily_adjacent_cycle.sh
```

Each script writes its artifacts under `aln-reference/`, `generated/`, and `research-logs/` and emits Prometheus examples under `prometheus/`.
