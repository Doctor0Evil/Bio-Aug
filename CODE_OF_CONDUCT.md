# Bio‑Aug Code of Conduct

Bio‑Aug is committed to creating a collaborative, ethical and safety-oriented project environment. This Code of Conduct complements the project’s safety, governance, and rights-first orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Be professional, collaborative, and respectful.
- Follow all laws and regulations applicable to research involving medical devices and human subjects.
- Ensure all safety claims are reproducible, supported by simulation data or certified clinical evidence.
- Disclose conflicts of interest (COIs) for any changes that affect clinical practice, vendor procurement, or policy enforcement.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The project enforces a zero-tolerance policy for the following:

- Falsifying safety data, simulation results, or regulatory status to influence policy, procurement, or user behavior.
- Hiding or failing to disclose conflicts of interest when proposing or reviewing policy or device binding changes.
- Discriminatory or harassing behavior or demeaning conduct toward other contributors.
- Attempts to bypass governance, audit logging, or signature processes; attempts to insert backdoors or hidden control paths.

## Reporting and Enforcement

- If you observe a breach of this Code of Conduct — including falsified safety data or unreported COI — report it confidentially to `security@bio-aug.org` and `governance@bio-aug.org`.
- The BGC will investigate and take appropriate action, which may include: requiring remediation, public correction, PR reversal, or contributor revocation.
- For urgent incidents involving potential patient harm, the Security Lead and Clinician Lead will enact emergency procedures, including revocation of affected policy bundles and immediate quarantine of impacted code paths.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

- When proposing changes that may create a vendor advantage, influence clinical decisions, or affect market procurement, explicitly disclose the COI in the PR description.
- A reviewer with a COI should abstain from the technical or governance approval process for that change.

## Sanctions

Violators of this Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently removed from the community depending on severity. The BGC will maintain records of sanctions and publish them in `governance/logs/` as permitted by privacy and legal constraints.

## Notes

This Code of Conduct supplements local laws and institutional rules; it does not replace them. Contributors must ensure compliance with all institutional review boards, clinical oversight, and statutory privacy obligations when working with real or simulated patient data.
