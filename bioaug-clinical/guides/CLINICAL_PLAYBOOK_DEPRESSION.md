# Bio-Aug Depression Neuromodulation Playbook (Clinician-Facing)

- Scope: Non-invasive / minimally-invasive neuromodulation for mood disorders with nano-enhanced stimulation, aligned with standardized neuromodulation safety envelopes and clinical SDLC practices. [web:18][web:23]
- Workflow:
  - Pre-screen subjects and record ConsentRecord (clinical/research dual scope where applicable).
  - Select protocols that respect cumulative dose constraints and exclude high-risk profiles.
  - Use SafetyOutcome fields to track response and adverse events; feed anonymized data into neuromorphic datasets for ongoing model refinement.
